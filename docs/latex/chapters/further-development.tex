\chapter{Further avenues of development}

While the program is already capable of providing good insights into many cities' basic travel patterns, it may be improved in the future in multiple ways. These include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a more robust networking system, capable of efficiently handling dropped packets and service disruptions -- this would require a medium-to-large scale refactoring of the code, and is feasible if any of the other features are implemented
    \item the addition of roads to the simulation model, making agents travel along these known good paths instead of the "as the crow flies" method
    \item different modes of transportation, including walking, car use and public transit
    \item adding real public transit lines with vehicles 
    \item interactive map with the ability to move and delete buildings or other objects
    \item general optimisations
\end{itemize}
